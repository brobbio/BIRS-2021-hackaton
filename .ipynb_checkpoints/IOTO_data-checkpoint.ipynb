This Bill simply asserts the right of the Legislative Assembly to give precedence to matters other than those expressed by the Sovereign. Introducing it at this point in the opening proceedings of this Legislative Assembly is a tradition that dates back to the reign of Elizabeth I when, on March 22, 1603, Parliament first recorded this assertion of independence from the Crown for purposes of legislation.

(8) Money demanded from a person by the grant administrator under this section becomes payable (a) as soon as the person is given the demand, if that person is indebted or liable to make a payment to the debtor at the time the demand is given, or (b) as soon as the person becomes indebted or liable to make a payment to the debtor, in any other case.

EBY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR HOUSING BILL 1 – 2020 AN ACT TO ENSURE THE SUPREMACY OF PARLIAMENT This Act to Ensure the Supremacy of Parliament is an important part of our democratic process. The purpose of this Bill, and its introduction prior to consideration of the Throne Speech, is to perpetuate the established right of Parliament, through its elected representatives, to sit and act without leave from the Crown. This Bill simply asserts the right of the Legislative Assembly to give precedence to matters other than those expressed by the Sovereign. Introducing it at this point in the opening proceedings of this Legislative Assembly is a tradition that dates back to the reign of Elizabeth I when, on March 22, 1603, Parliament first recorded this assertion of independence from the Crown for purposes of legislation.
